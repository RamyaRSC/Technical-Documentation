    <header>History</header>
    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, ease of use, and wide range of applications. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s while he was working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in the Netherlands. Van Rossum named it after his favorite television show, Monty Python's Flying Circus.</p>
    <p>The first version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. It was a simple language with only a handful of features, but it quickly gained popularity among developers because of its ease of use and flexibility.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years, Python saw several major releases, with new features and improvements being added each time. In 1994, version 1.0 of Python was released, and in 2000, version 2.0 was released, which introduced a number of important new features, including list comprehensions, garbage collection, and a built-in map function.</p>
    <p>Python 3.0 was released in December 2008, and it represented a major break from the earlier versions of the language. While Python 2 and Python 3 are largely similar, there are a number of differences between them, including changes to the print statement, changes to the way strings are handled, and the introduction of new modules.</p>
    <p>Despite these changes, Python has continued to grow in popularity over the years, and today it is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It is used in a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Many of the world's largest technology companies, including Google, Dropbox, and Instagram, use Python extensively in their products and services.</p>
    <p>In addition to its popularity in industry, Python has also become a popular language for teaching programming. Its simple syntax and ease of use make it a great language for beginners, and many universities and other educational institutions now offer courses in Python programming.</p>
    <p>Overall, the history of Python is one of steady growth and evolution, as the language has evolved from a simple tool for scripting to a powerful and versatile programming language that is used by developers all over the world.</p>
